# Prediction Trade — AI OS Instructions

> **Communication:** Always reply to the user in **Spanish**. All code, commits, docs, and comments in **English**.

---

## SESSION START PROTOCOL — "Hola PT" / "PT" / "Continúa PT"

When the user writes any of these triggers, execute this checklist **before doing anything else**:

```bash
# 1. Recent commits (what changed last)
git log --oneline -8

# 2. Working tree state (uncommitted changes or new files)
git status --short

# 3. TypeScript check (non-blocking — note errors, don't fix unless asked)
pnpm build 2>&1 | tail -20

# 4. Read brain/NEXT-SESSION.md (pending items and risks)
# 5. Read this file's ## CURRENT STATE section (latest checkpoint)
```

After running the checklist, report to the user **in Spanish**:
- ✅ Estado de Git (branch, last commit, clean/dirty)
- ✅ Estado de TypeScript (0 errors / N errors)
- ✅ Items pendientes más importantes (from NEXT-SESSION.md + CURRENT STATE)
- ✅ Suggested next action (concrete, actionable)

Then ask: "¿Continuamos con eso o tienes otra prioridad?"

## PROJECT IDENTITY

**Prediction Trade** (`predictiontrade.online`) is a **consumer social forecasting platform**.
Sole operator: aventurarte.23@gmail.com

- **Tagline:** "Predict. Compete. Share."
- **Hero line:** "Predict the Future. Prove You're Right."
- **Nature:** Social product. Users are **forecasters**, not traders.
- **Core loops:** Gamification → Social identity → Leaderboard → Share → Viral loop
- **GitHub:** `PredictionTradeHQ/pt-app`
- **Vercel workspace:** PT (separate from PMS workspace)

---

## ABSOLUTE SEPARATION — PT vs PMS

PT and PMS are **completely separate ecosystems**. This rule is non-negotiable.

| Dimension | PT (this project) | PMS (other project) |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature** | Consumer social platform | B2B SaaS infrastructure |
| **Path** | `Documents\PREDICTION TRADE\pt-infrastructure\pt-app\` | `Documents\PREDICTION MARKETS SOLUTIONS\pms-infrastructure\pms-core\` |
| **GitHub org** | `PredictionTradeHQ` | `PredictionMarketsSolutions` |
| **Vercel workspace** | PT workspace | PMS workspace |
| **Supabase** | `dvevwlhshcyvnsubyvzw` | separate project |
| **Domain** | `predictiontrade.online` | `predictionmarkets.market` |
| **Brand color** | social-dark UI | emerald `#10B981` |
| **Audience** | End users / forecasters | Operators / enterprises |

**Never cross these boundaries:**
- No shared code, logic, or utilities between PT and PMS
- No shared Supabase projects, Vercel projects, or GitHub orgs
- No shared branding, tone, or copy
- No adapted PMS skills for PT (and vice versa)
- Do not reference PMS from PT code or docs

## STACK

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16.2 App Router + React 19 + TypeScript 5.7 strict |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui + Radix UI |
| **State** | Zustand v5 with persist (localStorage) |
| **Database** | Supabase (`dvevwlhshcyvnsubyvzw`) — Auth + PostgreSQL + RLS |
| **Markets data** | Polymarket Gamma API (real-time, no-store cache) |
| **Deploy** | Vercel — auto-deploy on push to `main` |
| **Package manager** | pnpm |
| **Charts** | Recharts |

---

## CRITICAL CONSTANTS — DO NOT CHANGE

These are hardcoded throughout the codebase. Changing one breaks multiple files.

| Constant | Value | Why frozen |
|---|---|---|
| Starting balance | **$100,000** | Set in store, API, components, i18n, SEO |
| Markets nav | **`/markets`** (never `/demo`) | UX and SEO decision |
| Polymarket cache | **`cache: "no-store"`** | Always fresh data requirement |
| LiveMarketsPreview refresh | **30s + `?_t=Date.now()`** | Anti-caching strategy |
| Gamification store key | **`pt-gamification`** (v3) | localStorage key — migration required if changed |
| Zustand persist version | **v3** | Migrations from v1→v2→v3 already applied |
| Demo anchor usernames | **hardcoded in `lib/demo-leaderboard.ts`** | Profile links depend on slug stability |
| Supabase project ref | **`dvevwlhshcyvnsubyvzw`** | All API calls and env vars |
| Accuracy minimum | **≥5 resolved predictions** | Show accuracy% only when statistically meaningful |

## SUPABASE SCHEMA

No CLI available — use Supabase dashboard for DDL. `.env.local` does **not** have `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` locally (client-side only has `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).

**Active tables (production):**
- `profiles` — display_name, avatar, bio — auto-created on auth.users insert
- `wallets` — balance $100,000 initial — auto-created on signup
- `trades` — prediction records
- `activity_logs` — user activity feed
- `game_results` — Prediction Flash scores
- `academy_progress` — course completion
- `user_gamification` — ✅ LIVE — streaks, badges, accuracy, resolved predictions
- `public_leaderboard` — ✅ LIVE VIEW — server-side accuracy_pct, readable by anon+authenticated

**Pending SQL (optional, run in Supabase dashboard):**
- `supabase/migrations/002_profiles_username.sql` — `username` column + unique index + RLS UPDATE own

## CURRENT STATE — checkpoint 2026-05-15 ✅ STABLE

**Git:** `main` clean, synced with `origin/main`
**TypeScript:** 0 errors (strict mode)
**Vercel:** ● Ready — predictiontrade.online live

**Last commits:**
```
e588e18  docs(claude): update CURRENT STATE checkpoint to be4158c
be4158c  feat(profiles): server-side category accuracy + top calls on public profiles
3891faf  feat(ux): credibility pass — real stats, honest copy, social-first framing
36babf8  docs(claude): professional CLAUDE.md with session protocol + updated NEXT-SESSION
067e3b2  docs: infrastructure migration cleanup — canonical paths updated
```

**Completed phases:**
- ✅ Phase 0 — Foundation (Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, TypeScript strict)
- ✅ Phase 1 — Social Foundation (streaks, badges, shareable cards, categories, public profiles)
- ✅ Phase 2 — Social Identity Layer (leaderboard, demo anchors, home widgets, OG images)
- ✅ Phase 3 — Supabase Sync + Real Accuracy (user_gamification live, accuracy engine, Called It)
- ✅ Phase 4a — Real Leaderboard (Supabase VIEW, #1 Spotlight, real user merge)
- ✅ Phase 4b — Real Public Profiles (slugify, RealPublicProfile, /api/profile/[username])
- ✅ Phase 4c — Market Intelligence Signals (lib/market-signals.ts, 9 signal types, $0 cost)
- ✅ Phase 4d — Social Live Feeling (ActivityTicker, StreakAtRiskBanner, CategoryAccuracy)
- ✅ Phase 4e — Viral Social Loops (Share Profile, MilestoneCelebration, hero CTA)
- ✅ Phase 4f — Bet Flow Stability (parallel API writes, custom amount, no auth disruption)
- ✅ Phase 5a — UX Polish (mobile toast, balance modal, real ticker, Called It flow)
- ✅ Phase 5b — Lightweight Onboarding (auth callback → /markets, welcome banner, nudges)
- ✅ Phase 5c — Credibility Pass (honest stats, no fake features, social-first copy, real platform stats)
- ✅ Phase 5d — Public Profile Identity (server-side category accuracy, top calls, shareable headline)
- ✅ AI Skills Layer (PT-TONE-GUIDE.md, pt-called-it-post, pt-market-brief)

**⚠️ Pending operator action — NOT a dev task:**
Run `supabase/migrations/003_public_leaderboard_predictions.sql` in Supabase dashboard:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dvevwlhshcyvnsubyvzw/sql/new

Without it: category accuracy bars, "Best at X", "Biggest Calls" empty on public profiles (graceful fallbacks, no errors).
With it: all new profile sections activate instantly. No code changes needed.

**Other friction points (low urgency):**
- `supabase/migrations/002_profiles_username.sql` — optional username column, not needed yet
- Real ActivityTicker shows simulated data until real users accumulate activity

---

## PRIORITIES — next sessions

### Priority 0 — Operator action (2 min): Run migration 003
No dev needed — just run the SQL in Supabase dashboard. Unlocks full public profile identity layer.

### Priority 1 — Phase 4g: AI Layer (high impact, requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env.local` AND Vercel env vars (PT workspace)
2. Uncomment 10 lines in `app/api/ai/share-copy/route.ts` → Claude API live
3. Create `/api/ai/market-summary/route.ts` with Supabase cache (30 min TTL)
4. Add "Explain this market" button to market cards in `components/markets-app.tsx`
Estimated cost: ~$0.002/summary (haiku-4-5). 1,000/month ≈ $2.

### Priority 2 — Phase 5 Growth (longer term, needs user base first)
- Category leaderboards (per-category rankings on `/leaderboard`)
- Trending feed on home (dynamic, replaces static hero when >50 users)
- Automated content engine (Claude API → Buffer)

### Priority 3 — Optional cleanup (low urgency)
- Execute `supabase/migrations/002_profiles_username.sql` (indexed username lookup)
- Monitor ActivityTicker — real data auto-populates as users accumulate activity

## DEPLOY WORKFLOW

```bash
# 1. TypeScript check (required before deploy)
pnpm build

# 2. Push to GitHub (triggers Vercel auto-deploy)
git add <files>
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
git push

# 3. Manual deploy if needed
npx vercel --prod

# 4. Verify production
# Open predictiontrade.online — check key pages load
```

**Commit convention:** `type(scope): description`
- `feat(auth):` / `feat(leaderboard):` / `feat(ux):`
- `fix(wallet):` / `fix(profile):`
- `docs(brain):`

---

## TONE & VOICE

Read `.claude/PT-TONE-GUIDE.md` before generating any copy, AI output, or skill content.

**PT sounds like:** "You called it. 7 days in a row." "Only 4% hit this streak."
**PT does NOT sound like:** "Portfolio P&L", "leverage", "settlement", "contracts"

Core test: *"Does this make the user feel like a skilled person in a community, or like a trader in a market?"*

---

## AI SKILLS

| File | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/skills/pt-called-it-post.md` | User wants to share a correct prediction | Viral copy for X, Instagram, WhatsApp |
| `.claude/skills/pt-market-brief.md` | "Explain this market" | 2–4 sentence plain-language market summary |

**Never adapt or reuse PMS skills for PT.**

## PRINCIPLES

1. This is a social consumer product — keep it simple, UX-first, visual, fast
2. Do not add features speculatively — ship and validate
3. Always run `pnpm build` before deploying — TypeScript strict is non-negotiable
4. PT and PMS are separate ecosystems — never mix them for any reason
5. localStorage is source of truth; Supabase is sync layer (offline resilience preserved)
6. Demo anchor users are a permanent UX pattern — do not remove them
7. Accuracy requires ≥5 resolved predictions before displaying a percentage
8. Polymarket API always fetches fresh — never cache market prices
